# gifster

> because giphy is ~too mainstream~.

This is a toy project created with Sinatra. Its a local catalog of your favorite gifs, so instead of guess-searching on Google for that awesome gif you saw once and never again, you can just collect and have them all offline at your pleasure. 

Gifs are imported by URL.

Don't take this too seriously, it's just a pet project I created to learn Ruby :P

## Install if you want

Considering you have your Ruby environment set up, clone and run `bundle install`. This thing uses sqlite.
